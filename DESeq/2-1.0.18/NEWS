CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.10
-------------------------

    o Outlier detection: Cook's distances are calculated for each
      sample per gene and the matrix is stored in the assays list.
      These values are used to determine genes in which a single 
      sample disproportionately influences the fitted coefficients. 
      These genes are flagged and the p-values set to NA.
      The argument 'cooksCutoff' of nbinomWaldTest() and 
      nbinomLRT() can be used to control this functionality.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

    o Base class: SummarizedExperiment is used as the superclass 
      for storing the data.

    o Workflow: The wrapper function DESeq() performs all steps 
      for a differential expression analysis. Individual steps are 
      still accessible.

    o Statistics: Incorporation of prior distributions into the 
      estimation of dispersions and fold changes (empirical-Bayes 
      shrinkage). A Wald test for significance is provided as the 
      default inference method, with the likelihood ratio test of 
      the previous version also available.

    o Normalization: it is possible to provide a matrix of sample- 
      *and* gene-specific normalization factors
