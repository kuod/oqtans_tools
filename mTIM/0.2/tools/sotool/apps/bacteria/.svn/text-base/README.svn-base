/apps/bacteria/model - State model
/apps/bacteria/ - main files for preparing, training and evaluation
/apps/hmsvm/ - Viterbi and Files necessary for hidden Markov applications
/apps/hmsvm/models - two models for testing (test data generator included, 
just store the files in /data)

/data/Organism - dna files.
Attention: at the moment it is not possible to interact with these files 
directly. An external tool is used to convert these files to
/data/Organism/mat files which can be read and converted afterwards and 
solutions are stored in /data/Organism/data.mat (This file is essential)

e.g. 
/data/Escherichia_coli_BW2952_uid59391 - raw files
/data/Escherichia_coli_BW2952_uid59391/mat - 1 file per example (using 
external tool, generated from raw files)
/data/Escherichia_coli_BW2952_uid59391/data.mat - converted example files
this file is essential for training and prediction
